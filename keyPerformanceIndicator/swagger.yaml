    According to Wikipedia a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a type of performance measurement.
    KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages.
    
    The present data model defines a type of NGSI entity which captures the value and associated details of a key performance
    indicator. The data model is flexible enough to accommodate different usage scenarios: An entity per KPI calculation or 
    a unique entity per KPI which value evolves along time. Please note that in the latter case a historical module, such 
    as the STH, would have to take care of the KPI evolution.
