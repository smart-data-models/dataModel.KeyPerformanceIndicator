# dataModel.KeyPerformanceIndicator


The following entity types are available:
- [keyPerformanceIndicator](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.KeyPerformanceIndicator/blob/master/keyPerformanceIndicator/README.md). According to Wikipedia a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a type of performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages. The present data model defines a type of NGSI entity which captures the value and associated details of a key performance indicator. The data model is flexible enough to accommodate different usage scenarios: An entity per KPI calculation or a unique entity per KPI which value evolves along time. Please note that in the latter case a historical module, such as the STH, would have to take care of the KPI evolution..
